# Hello There Sir Or Madam

This quiz application is something that really helped me understand not only JavaScript but programming a little more. Later at some point it would be a good idea to have my questions and answers be in a different JavaScript or JSON file.

If you look into my JavaScript file you'll more than likely see my inexperience glowing. I built this application three times and each time I built it my logic turned out the exact same each time, without me looking at my previous attempts.

Either way, I wanted this quiz app to have the same styling and feel that Codecademy has on there quizzes. I really liked the way it was designed so I tried to emulate it with a little bit of my own twist.
